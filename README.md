## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/discoverswiss/profile-notification-csharp-example.git
cd profile-notification-csharp-example
```

2. **Set up local configuration**

Create a `local.settings.json` file in the root directory. This file contains environment variables needed for running the function locally and **is excluded from version control** by `.gitignore`.

Here‚Äôs an example you can use:

```json
{
  "IsEncrypted": false,
  "Values": {
    "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",
    "ServiceBusConnectionString": "<your-connection-string>"
  }
}
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Replace `<your-connection-string>` with your Azure Service Bus connection string containing access to the queue that receives profile notifications.

3. **Run locally**

```bash
func start
```

4. **Deploy to Azure (optional)**

```bash
func azure functionapp publish <YourFunctionAppName>
```
